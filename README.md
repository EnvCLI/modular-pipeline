# Modular CI Pipeline

The `mpi` script aims to abstract away many of the steps needed to develop, test and deploy a software project. It is a replacement for READMEs and other documents that may become out-of-date, and when maintained properly, should provide a cohesive and discoverable interface for common project tasks.
